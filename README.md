# Scripts for Puma Black CST

This is a collection of automatizations, scripts and resources I'll be making to help the work flow of the CTF team that I'm currently on. (Puma Black Ops).

## What I'll save here and what not?
Normally I won't save tools, because, in most cases, that should be handled by your distribution repositories. For this cases (My team currently works in Kali so that'll be the standard reference.) I'll put the indications of which tool you need to have installed for the resource you want to use.

I'll only do exceptions to this rule in the cases where the tool is not currently available in the standard repository for the distribution we're using (Currently Kali Linux). But, even in this case, I'll not store the tool but a reference to its repo in form of a submodule.
